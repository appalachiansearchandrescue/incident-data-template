SAR Incident Data Template
==========================

This is a sample structure for sharing SAR incident data among geographically separate teams while the incident is ongoing. For more information about remote support workflows, see https://emenendez.github.io/remote-support-workflow/.

Instructions
------------

1. [Download](https://github.com/appalachiansearchandrescue/incident-data-template/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository and extract it to your organization's incident Dropbox or other shared folder.

2. Rename the folder to `<Incident No> <County>`.

3. Make the folder structure work for you; add, remove, and rename folders to fit your specific incident. These folders will likely start out sparse and gradually be filled in as the incident progresses.

4. [Feedback](https://github.com/appalachiansearchandrescue/incident-data-template/issues/new) is always appreciated!

Folder contents

*Analysis*: Specific analyses such as subject mobility, cell phone coverage, probability models.
